        <div >
        <h2>JavaScript Home</h2>
        <p>JavaScript is easy to learn. It is used to program the behavior of web pages. JavaScript and Java are completely different languages, both in concept and design.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>JavaScript Introduction</h2>
        <p>Javascript can change HTML content by using <b>getElementById()</b>. It can also change HTML attribute values, e.g. changing the source value of an image,and also change CSS styles e.g the font-size,hide or show HTML elements. </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>JavaScript in body</h2>
        <p>JavaScript code can be placed in the <b>&lt;body&gt;</b> section, <b>&lt; head &gt;</b> section or in both of an HTML page. Externally, it could be placed in external files with <b>.js</b> file extension. External scripts is preferred because it separates HTML and code, it makes HTML and JavaScript easier to read and cached JavaScript files can speed up page loads.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>JavaScript Output</h2>
        <p>JavaScript can display data by using: </p>
            <ol>
                <li>innerHTML.</li>
                <li>document.write() which is useful for testing purposes. </li>
                <li>window.alert</li>
                <li>console.log() for debugging purposes</li>
                <li>window.print() to print the content from the current window.</li>

            </ol>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>JavaScript Statement</h2>
        <p>JavaScript statements are composed of: <b>Values, Operators, Expressions, Keywords, and Comments</b>. JavaScript statements are separated by <b>Semicolons</b>.There are lot of JavaScript keywords like var, if...else  etc.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>JavaScript Syntax</h2>
<p>The JavaScript syntax defines two types of values: <b>Fixed values</b> which are also called <i>literals</i> and <b>Variable values</b> also called <i>variables</i>. JavaScript uses the <i>var</i> keyword to declare variables and an equal sign(=) is used to assign values to variables. JavaScript is case sensitive. JavaScript programmers tend to use camel case that starts with a lowercase letter:firstName, masterCard.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      </p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>JavaScript Comments</h2>
<p>The comment tag is used to explain codes or stop the codes from being executed by JavaScript. Single line comments starts with // and ends with //. Any text between these lines will not be executed by JavaScript. Multi-line comments starts with /* and ends with */. </p>
</div> 
<div>
<h2>JavaScript Variables</h2>
<p>Variables must be identified by unique names called <b>Identifiers</b>. JavaScript data types are mainly strings which are usually enclosed with either a single or double quotes, and numbers which are without quotes. You can declare many variables in one statement. A variable declared without a value will have the value <emp>undefined</emp>. </p> 
</div>
<div>
<h2>JavaScript Operators</h2>
<p>Some of the operators include = which assigns data values, + which adds numbers and concatenate strings,/for division. Others include *-multiplication, ** exponetation etc. The addition assignment operator (+=) adds a value to a variable and concatenate strings.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>JavaScript Arithmetic</h2>
<p>The numbers (in an arithmetic operation) are called <b>Operands</b>. The operation (to be performed between the two operands) is defined by an operator. Some of the operators include:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>The addition operator (+) adds numbers</li>
        <li>The subtraction operator (-) subtracts numbers</li>
        <li>The multiplication operator (*) multiplies numbers</li>
        <li>The division operator (/) divides numbers</li>
        <li>The modulus operator (%) returns the division remainder</li>
        <li>The increment operator (++) increments numbers</li>
        <li>The decrement operator (--) decrements numbers</li>
        <li>The exponentiation operator (**) raises the first operand to the power of the second operand</li>
    </ol>
    <p>It is important to note that x ** y produces the same result as Math.pow(x,y)</p>
